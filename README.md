> Guess I'm Doing Fine - Bob Dylan
```css
Well, I ain’t got my childhood
Or friends I once did know
But I still got my voice left
I can take it anywhere I go
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doin’ fine

And I’ve never had much money
But I’m still around somehow
Many times I’ve bended
But I ain’t never yet bowed
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doin’ fine

Trouble, oh trouble
I’ve trouble on my mind
But the trouble in the world, Lord
Is much more bigger than mine
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doin’ fine

And I never had no armies
To jump at my command
But I don’t need no armies
I got me one good friend
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doin’ fine

I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
But as long as the world keeps a-turnin’
I just keep a-turnin’ too
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doin’ fine

Well, my road might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
But as some folks ain’t got no road at all
They gotta stand in the same old place
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doin’ fine
```
